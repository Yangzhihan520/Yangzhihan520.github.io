	<p class="Li">The Nissan 240Z, or Datsun 240Z, is the first of Nissan's Z-series sports cars. Produced from 1969 to 1974, it's a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-seater. Influenced by European models, it has an eye-catching exterior. Powered by an L24 2.4-liter inline-six engine with 151 horsepower, it offers manual or automatic transmission. Its pressed steel chassis and independent suspensions ensure stability. The interior is driver-focused with basic comforts. Selling over 550,000 units globally, it's an automotive classic and laid the groundwork for Nissan's sports car line.  </p>
